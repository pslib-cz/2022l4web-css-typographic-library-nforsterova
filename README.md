## Implementation
1. Download Typhography library in  **[documents/download](./)** folder
2. Add this file to your project 
3. Link style.css to `<head>` in every HTML page by using:
    ```html
    <link href="maestro.css" rel="stylesheet">
    ```
## Headings 
This CSS library includes styled headings from `<h1>` to `<h2>`. They have two colors and different sizes: 
* 30px for `<h1>`
* 24px for `<h2>`
* 19px for `<h3>`
* 16px for `<h4>`
* 13px for `<h5>`
* 10px for `<h5>`
## Types of text
Other types of text you can use are:
- `<u>` for __underlined__ text
- `<b>` for **bold** text
- `<s>` for ~~striked~~ text
- `<mark>` for marked text with color
- `<i>` for *italic* text
- `class="small"` for small text
- `class="all-caps"` for CAPS text
## Lists
### Ordered list
For ordered lists we use `<ol>` tag. For his items we use `<li>` tags. Syntax:
```html
<ol>
    <li>First item that have more items
        <ol>
            <li>First item detail</li>
            <li>Second item detail</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Second item</li>
</ol>
```
### Unordered list
For ordered lists we use `<ul>` tag. For his items we use `<li>` tags. Syntax:
```html
<ul>
    <li>Item
        <ul>
            <li>More of item</li>
            <li>More of item</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li> Another item</li>
</ul>
```
## Buttons
If you want to use some clikable buttons in your project, you can use `<button>` tag. In this library, there are three types of buttons. You use them by adding class:
- Use class `class="btn-buy"` for purple button.
- Use class `class="btn-save"` for button that changes colors.
- Use class `class="btn-warning"` for warning button.
## Pictures
With help of element `<img>` we add an image into our document. There is an example of how to do that:
```html
<figure class="img__box">
    <a href="./img/picture.jpg">
        <img src="./img/picture.jpg" alt="some alternative text">
        <figcaption class="img__caption">Any caption you write</figcaption>
    </a>
</figure>
```
## The end
I hope you find this CSS typhography gallery helpful in your projects:)
